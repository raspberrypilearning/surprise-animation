In your project, you made an animation with a surprise. Click on the green flag to run the animation below, then run it again.

<div class="scratch-preview" style="margin-left: 15px;">
  <iframe allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/embed/499932713/?autostart=false" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>

Did you notice anything odd the second time? The surprise was ruined! What code block would you add to make the surprise work?
