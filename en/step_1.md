## Introduction

You will create a short animation with a surprise.

<p style="border: solid; border-width:2px; border-color: black; padding: 10px;">
You will:
+ Use Scratch to create an animation,
+ Test and debug your code when you make changes,
+ Break an animation into parts, this is called **decomposition**, and build it one part at a time.
</p>

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
**Decomposition** is breaking a project down into parts that are smaller and easier to understand. This means that you can build a project one part at a time until you have completed it.

Have you written a story with a plot twist or a surprise? Maybe you have watched a show or read a book with an unpredictable ending? You can use the same methods when creating a digital story or animation.

### Get inspiration 

--- task ---

You are going to make design decisions and come up with a story for your surprise animation.  You will need to **set up** the scene with character and curious object, show the character's curiosity about the object, create a surprise, and add a reaction. 

Think about what your story might be as you explore these example projects to get more ideas:

There are people called <span style="color: #0faeb0">narrative designers</span> who do storytelling for apps and video games. But digital storytelling allows everyone to share their stories and creative imaginings with other people.
