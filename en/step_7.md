## Upgrade your project

If you have time, you can upgrade your project. 

You could:
+ Add to or improve your animation, with movement, looks, and graphic effects
+ Create or edit costumes in the Paint editor to make them look the way that you want
+ Record your voice or record sound effects and add the new sounds to your project
