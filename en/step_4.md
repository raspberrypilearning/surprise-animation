## Surprise

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
Now, you need to add a surprise. What could happen to the object? 
- Will it turn into another object? 
- Will it turn into a character? 
- Will it disappear and reveal another sprite? 

You decide!

Have you written a story with a plot twist or a surprise? Have you watched a show or read a book with an unpredictable ending? You can use the same methods when you create a digital story or animation.

### When will the surprise happen?

--- task ---

Select the **object** sprite. Add a script to make the surprise start when you want it to. 

You will need to choose a time delay that works for your project. If you have a character that spends a long time being curious, you will need to choose a longer delay.

[[[scratch3-time-delay]]]

--- /task ---

### Now, create the surprise!

--- task ---

The object could `play a sound`{:class="block3sound"}, `switch costume`{:class="block3looks"}, `change graphic effects`{:class="block3looks"}, or `change size`{:class="block3looks"}.

You could add a surprising costume to the sprite, then the sprite could `switch costume`{:class="block3looks"} to reveal it. For example, you could make the **Apple** turn into a **Ghost**.

[[[scratch3-add-costumes-to-a-sprite]]]

You could make the sprite seem to turn into a different sprite â€” to do this, `hide`{:class="block3looks"} the **object** sprite at the same time as you `show`{:class="block3looks"} another sprite.

--- collapse ---

title: Hide and show sprites

The **object** sprite:
```blocks3
when [timer v] > (4) // set the delay
hide
```

A **surprise** sprite:
```blocks3
when [timer v] > (4) // same delay
show
```

**Tip:** If you make a **surprise** sprite `show`{:class="block3looks"}, you will need to make it `hide`{:class="block3looks"} `when green flag clicked`{:class="block3events"}.

**Test:** Click on the green flag. Does the surprise happen at the right time? Does the animation reset properly?

**Debug:**

If you need a sprite to be in front of or behind another sprite, you can use layers:

If the surprise happens at the wrong time, you can fix that:

Make sure that you have selected the `timer`{:class="block3events"} option in the `when loudness`{:class="block3events"} block:

```blocks3
when [timer v] > [5]
```

If you have the `timer`{:class="block3events"} selected correctly, try adjusting the amount of time that the timer waits.
