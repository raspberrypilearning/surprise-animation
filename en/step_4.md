## Surprise

Now you need to add a surprise. What could happen to the object? 
- Will it turn into another object? 
- Will it turn into a character? 
- Will it disappear and reveal another sprite? 
You decide.

You can make a script 

```blocks3
when [timer > 5] // change the delay
```

--- /collapse ---

--- /task ---

The object could `play a sound`{:class="block3sounds"}, `switch costume`{:class="block3looks"}, `change graphic effects`{:class="block3looks"}, `change size`{:class="block3looks"}. It could hide and another object could appear in its place. It could do a few of these things.

You could make a sprite appear to turn into a different sprite by hiding one sprite and showing the other at the same time.

You'll need to add another sprite if you choose this option.

**Tip:** If you make a different object `show`{:class="block3looks"}, then you will need to make it `hide`{:class="block3looks"} `when flag clicked`{:class="block3events"}

You could create a new costume by copying parts from one sprites's costume to another.
