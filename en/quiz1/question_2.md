In your project, you planned the animation with `timer` or `wait` blocks. 

In this dinosaur project, you want the little dinosaur to wait 6 seconds before popping out of the egg and surprising the big dinosaur.

Which script for the little dinosaur sprite would make this happen?

--- choices ---

- ( ) 
```blocks3
when [loudness v] > (6)
show
```

  --- feedback ---

 These are the right blocks to use but you need to select 'timer' instead of 'loudness' from the dropdown.

- ( ) 
```blocks3
when sprite clicked
show
```

  --- feedback ---

This script needs user interaction for the little dinosaur to show.

```blocks3

when flag clicked
wait (6) seconds
```

 Here, the little dinosaur surprises the big one and then waits 6 seconds.

```blocks3
when [timer v] > (6)
show

 When the timer has waited 6 seconds, the little dinosaur appears and surprises the big dinosaur!
