## Reaction

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
Now, your main character needs to react to the surprise. What will they do? 
- When will your main character react?
- How will they emote? 
- Will they say something, make a sound, change costumes, move? 

You decide!

**Debug:** 

You might need to change the time in `when timer`{:class="block3events"} and `wait`{:class="block3control"} blocks or add more `wait`{:class="block3control"} blocks to get the timing just right.
